Frogger game.

Instructions to play.

The index.html file must be opened in a web browser in order for the game to be played.

The player is a character whose initial position is on the green part of the screen (grass).
The player has to cross the path and reach the water. On the way to the water there are bugs
that cross the path and the player must avoid them. If a collision happens between the player
and one of the bugs then the player loses all of their scores and has to start from the beginning.

Every time the player reaches the water without colliding with bugs a point is won.
The points accumulate to create the total score.

At random times there are gems that appear at random places. If the player collects a gem
then one gem can save the player one time in case of a collision with a bug.

There are a number of characters to choose from for the sprite of the player.
To change characters the user has to push the ‘c’ button on the keyboard.

Character abilities:
All characters except Cat Girl move at a faster pace but that makes them less accurate
at positioning and it is hard for them to pick the gems.
The Cat Girl moves at a slower pace but can position herself very accurately.
If you want to pick the gem it is best to change character to Cat Girl.
To run away after that switch to another character.
